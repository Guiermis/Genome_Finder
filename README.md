### Genome_Finder

# SA-LU-TATIONS!

This is my Conclusion Project for technical course I've went through, so let me explain somethings about it. Hope you enjoy it! :)

# Concept:

- The project is within the Biology field of study, since it's main purpose it's to registrate little Genome Sequences.
- It isn't very detailed, since the purpose of it was to improve technical skills in C# and Web Development with a Backend.
- In the Home Page you can see all the functions it has, but, some of then need to be worked to really have a meaning to be there.
- The Website it's in portuguese, so, it may be not that simple to navigate if you're not a portuguese speaker.

# Technical Part:

- Genome Finder uses ASP.net for interactions between the Front-End and the Back-End, and for communicating with it's Database, but we'll get to that later.
- The Files are organized within the MVC structure, so, you may find it easy to go through the files.
- The pages have a simple CSS3 style applied to them, but, the graph page does not use CSS3 for rendering neither stylizing the graph.
- The graph and the submit form are the only pages to use morre JavaScript, from Controlling User Input to Displaying the graph.
- The DB of choice was SQL Server, since it has a very easy way to connect within the Visual Studio IDE using ASP.net.
- The trajectory of the Data is quite simple to, mainly to prioritize performance.
- When the User requests the data to be shown in the graph, the MVC sends to the JS controller with the Json structure.

# Know Issues:

- The Login page doesn't exist neither it has an utility.
- The Species name does not display in graph after it's requested, this can be a issue within it's trajectory.
- User can send any type of data that he want's in the form, since there is no way to analyse it.
- The graph doesn't work sometimes.

# Conclusion:

This project is the first thing I've made that I was really proud about, even with it's issues.
So, this isn't the perfect example of what I can do within the Web Development, but it showed to me that I can improve a lot from other things I've made.
And, this project isn't going to be updated until I have more space to download Visual Studio and SQL Server again, until then, it will be a mark in my trajectory as a programmer.
To finish this, if you saw this project and want to try something similar, do it! Don't let people tell you what's great or isn't, and if you make something wrong in the path, don't worry, it will only make you stronger!
Thank you for being interested in what I have to offer, even if it isn't much, someday I will make something better!

That's all, bye bye! :)
